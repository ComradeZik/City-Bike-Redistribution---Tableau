The Citi Bike is a bike-sharing system that serves the greater New York City area and parts of New Jersey launched in May, 2013
The service has since doubled its size from the initial 6,000 bikes and 332 stations to 12,000 bikes and 700 stations in 2017. Currently, Citi Bike has reached 24500 bikes & 1500+ stations.
Based on the research of Kaufman, it is estimated that Citi Bike will expand its service area across the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and increase the number of bikes to 40,000.
However, problems such as bike redistribution, dock station maintenance, and bike attrition arose with the expansion of services.
 
## 1. Re-balancing System & Rational
In seeking to optimize management of the current Bike-sharing system, we discovered that solving the issue of bicycle re-balancing becomes more crucial.
We will be focusing on three perspectives: Where? When? And How? to improve the re-balancing system.
Our rationale behind the system is 1. To increase the number of docks in areas to meet the increasing demand. 2. To establish a dynamic transport system to balance the demand in different areas.
 
## 2. Bike Availability & Bike Usage Time-line & Stations Needed Maintenance
In creating the dashboard of bike availability, we applied the clean data and filtered them into dock name and month of date to show the corresponding availability by different intensity of colors.
(for bike usage time-line, as you can see from the story page, we filtered the data into weekdays and day of hours, and showed the result as Avg. Avail Bikes.)
(for the stations needed maintenance , we set up the average broken docks that were greater than 4 as the benchmark to show the stations that needed the most for the maintenance at selected time)
 
## 3. Citi-bike Analyzer
Combining with the bike availability, bike usage time-line, and stations needed maintenance, we established the citi-bike analyzer which helps us to identify at a specific time what the bike availability is, and which stations that need the maintenance the most out of the total stations.
 
 
## 4. Cost Analysis & Conclusion
As you can see from the table, It'll cost riders $3.5 to unlock the classic bike; and after 30 minutes, it will cost an extra $0.18 per minute. According to Oâ€™Mahony (2015) and Shapiro (2017), the average cost of moving a bike is over $1 and the average cost of adding a bike to the station will be $6,000. The $6000 per bicycle contains all the other variable costs of operating. (e.g. the cost of adding a new dock, the costs of maintenance, and rebalancing costs.)
 
As our main objective is to ensure an appropriate quantity of bikes during rushed-hours and enough capacity of docks to place bikes, we propose two solutions by applying the citi bike analyzer. First, to add more docks at designated stations so that the increased bike capacity will alleviate the problem of bike imbalance. Second, to establish a dynamic bike transport system to help balance the demand in different areas.
 
### Overall, for this project, we used analytical insights to explore usage patterns and customer behavior so our team can better adjust the system for the future. Investments on conducting this analysis will be ultimately paid back by more long-run benefits and will help to achieve sustainability and business development.
